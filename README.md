### About
“National Park Domination Map” is a light-weight and fun informational site for outdoor travelers. Users can select each national park that they have visited from a dominant map, and the corresponding map area will be highlighted. Users can also mark the national park that they wish to visit.
The webpage stores and displays all US national parks’ basic information. Users could drill down from the main page and be led to the second level detail pages. The users can leave comments and rate a park from 1-5.
Users can like comments. Then the website ranks parks/users/reviews from user interactivity. The results are pushed out on a monthly basis.
